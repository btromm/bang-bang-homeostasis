# bang-bang-homeostasis
## written in C++

simple direct conductance-based bang-bang controller for xolotl

ignores mRNA concentration entirely
instead, this implementation modifies conductances directly based on calcium error

## installation:

* put the bang-bang folder in xolotl/c++/mechanisms/
* use the darn matlab file to run it. darn easy front-end!
