# bang-bang-homeostasis
## written in C++

simple direct conductance-based bang-bang controller for xolotl

ignores mRNA concentration entirely
instead, this implementation modifies conductances directly based on calcium error

## installation:

* put .hpp in xolotl/c++/mechanisms/[whatever-you-want]/
* use the darn matlab file to use it. darn easy front-end!
