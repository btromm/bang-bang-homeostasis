# Bang Bang Controller for Xolotl
## July 18, 2019
---
## Description

This calcium-dependent homeostatic mechanism ignores mRNA concentration entirely.
Instead, these controllers modify conductances or mRNA levels in a binary fashion based on calcium error

## Installation:

* Transfer .hpp files to .../xolotl/c++/mechanisms/misc/
* Done! Client code available to reproduce my own examples

*NOTE*: For xolotl instructions, see: https://go.brandeis.edu/xolotl
